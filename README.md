# Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) of Global Air Pollution with data from The World Bank

## Introduction

This project aims to explore and analyze global air pollution data, with a focus on PM2.5 concentration levels, to uncover trends, insights, and regional disparities. 

Python will be our main tool, ideal for its strong data analysis and visualization libraries, enabling us to dig into PM2.5 air quality data efficiently.

Using an Agile methodology, we approach this work in iterative cycles, allowing for continuous improvement, adaptation, and incorporation of feedback at every stage. Although this is a solo project, we will still benefit by learning about the method and applying it hands on.

**What is PM2.5?**

PM2.5 refers to particulate matter that is 2.5 micrometers in diameter or smaller. These fine particles are so small that they can only be detected with an electron microscope. PM2.5 particles are produced by various sources, including combustion processes (such as vehicle engines, power plants, residential heating, wildfires), industrial processes, and certain chemical reactions in the atmosphere. Due to their tiny size, they can remain in the air for longer periods and travel further distances compared to larger particles.

**Why PM2.5 matters?** 

PM2.5 matters significantly due to its profound impact on public health, the environment, and climate. These fine particles penetrate deep into the human respiratory system and bloodstream, causing severe health issues, including respiratory infections, heart disease, and premature death. Environmentally, PM2.5 contributes to visibility reduction, acid rain, and ecosystem imbalance, affecting both natural landscapes and agricultural productivity. Additionally, certain PM2.5 components, like black carbon, play a role in climate change by influencing cloud formation and accelerating ice melt. Given these impacts, understanding and controlling PM2.5 pollution is crucial for safeguarding human health, preserving environmental integrity, and mitigating climate change effects.[1](https://www.stateofglobalair.org/health/pm)


## Objective

- Conduct a detailed Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on global air pollution.
- Identify key trends and patterns in PM2.5 levels across different regions and over time.
- Evaluate the impact of socioeconomic factors on air pollution levels.
- Apply the Agile methodology and develop my skills using Python as a Data Analyst.

## Agile Methodology Overview

- **Sprint Planning**: Break the project into smaller, manageable sprints, each with specific goals (e.g., data cleaning, initial analysis, in-depth analysis).
- **Iterative Development**: Develop the project in iterations, allowing for flexibility to adapt based on findings and feedback.
- **Review and Retrospective**: At the end of each sprint, review progress and conduct a retrospective to identify improvements for the next sprint.
- **Continuous Collaboration**: Engage with stakeholders (e.g., project advisors, peers) for feedback and incorporate suggestions to enhance the project.

## Data Source

The dataset is sourced from the [World Bank Global Air Pollution Database](https://databank.worldbank.org/reports.aspx?source=2%20&series=EN.ATM.PM25.MC.M3&country=). 

# Project Progress: Sprints Breakdown

### Sprint 1: Project Setup and Data Exploration
#### Initialize Project Structure
[DONE] Research and understand the subject matter.

[DONE] Create a GitHub repository for the project.

[DONE] Set up a directory structure within the repository (e.g., for datasets, documentation, source code, notebooks).

[DONE] Add essential files: README.md for project documentation, .gitignore to exclude unnecessary files from Git tracking, and LICENSE if applicable.

#### Obtain and Explore the Dataset

[-] Download the dataset and add it to your project repository in the designated directory.

[-] Load the dataset in a Jupyter notebook or Python script.

#### Perform an initial exploration:
[-] Check the size of the dataset (number of rows and columns).

[-] Examine the types of data (numerical, categorical) and look for any immediate
inconsistencies or missing values.

[-] Generate basic statistics (mean, median, standard deviation, etc.) to get a feel for the data distributions.

[-] Visualize the data with basic plots (histograms, scatter plots) to identify any patterns or outliers.

#### Identify Preliminary Findings
[-] Note any interesting trends or anomalies in the data that could warrant further investigation.

[-] Document any hypotheses or questions that arise during the initial data exploration.

**Deliverables**: Project repository setup, initial data exploration notebook.

### Sprint 2: Data Cleaning and Preprocessing
- **Goals**: Clean and preprocess the data for analysis.
- **Deliverables**: Cleaned dataset, documentation of cleaning process.

### Sprint 3: Initial Data Analysis
- **Goals**: Conduct initial analysis to identify trends, patterns, and outliers.
- **Deliverables**: Analysis notebook with visualizations and initial insights.

### Sprint 4: In-depth Analysis
- **Goals**: Dive deeper into the data to explore correlations and hypotheses.
- **Deliverables**: Detailed analysis report, advanced visualizations, and findings.

### Sprint 5: Final Review and Presentation
- **Goals**: Synthesize findings, prepare a final presentation, and refine documentation.
- **Deliverables**: Final presentation, comprehensive README, and project documentation.
